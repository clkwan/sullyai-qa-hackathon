# Hotel Booking API

A simple REST API for hotel bookings built with TypeScript, Express, and SQLite. This project serves as a sample for QA/release engineering interview hackathons.

## Features

- RESTful API for hotel bookings
- Local SQLite database
- No authentication required
- CRUD operations for hotels, users, rooms, and bookings

## Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:

- **hotels**: Store hotel information
- **users**: Store user information
- **rooms**: Store room information for hotels
- **bookings**: Store booking information

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Odiggo/sullyai-qa-hackathon.git
   cd sullyai-qa-hackathon
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Seed the database with sample data:
   ```
   npm run seed
   ```

## Development

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server with hot-reloading
- `npm run build`: Build the project for production
- `npm start`: Start the production server
- `npm run seed`: Seed the database with sample data

## Testing

This project is designed for QA/release engineering interview hackathons. Candidates can:

1. Add tests for the API endpoints
2. Build a CI/CD pipeline for releases
3. Implement automated testing strategies

## Resources for Hackathon

The following resources are provided to help candidates complete the hackathon challenge:

### API Documentation

An OpenAPI/Swagger specification is available in the `api-docs` folder. This provides a detailed description of all API endpoints, request/response models, and examples.

To view the API documentation in an interactive format, you can:
1. Open [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
2. Copy the contents of `api-docs/openapi.yaml` into the editor

### Sample Data

Example request and response payloads can be found in the `data/samples` directory. These examples demonstrate the expected format for API interactions and can be used as a reference when writing tests.

### Postman Collection

A Postman collection is available in the `postman` directory to help you get started with API testing. 

To use it:
1. Open Postman
2. Import the collection from `postman/hotel-booking-api.postman_collection.json`
3. Set the environment variable `baseUrl` to `http://localhost:3000/api` when testing locally

## Hackathon Challenge

For details about the hackathon challenge, including tasks, deliverables, and evaluation criteria, please refer to the [HACKATHON.md](./HACKATHON.md) file.

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses **Pytest** for API integration tests with structured logging captured in HTML reports.

### Running Tests Locally

1. Ensure the mock API server is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   npm run seed  # if needed, to reload seed data
2. Activate your Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
4. Open the HTML report:
   open report.html
